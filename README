Life and Times of Frog? is a Frogger-ish point-and-click adventure game where
you control a frog called Frog?.

'Frog?' may be interpreted in two ways, both of which are equally valid: either
'?' is a glob to avoid infringing on the Frogger trademark, or this frog is
having an existential crisis.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

This should work wherever Pygame does.  On systems with a sh-compatible shell,
do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run game.py with your Python 2
executable.

    CONTROLS

left-click: move; inspect or interact with objects.
right-click: pick up, drop or use objects.
middle-click: move; drop objects. (This allows you to move on top of an object
              or put an object on another (as long as the target object is
              flat.)
